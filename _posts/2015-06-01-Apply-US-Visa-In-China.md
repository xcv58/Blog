I have one month vacation, and go back to China. So I need to renew my US F-1 Visa.

In short, you have to fill some documents, pay fees and make appointment.

# My interview experience

My appointment time is 2015-05-28 8:30am.
My good friend come with me, we arrive US Embassy around 8:00am.

There is a very long line. But there're lots of peopel with appointment time after 9:00am.
So they're not allowed to enter the Embassy. I need to thru the crowd and say "excuse me" hundred times.

After that, the procedure is:

1. security check and a short line.

2. documents check, there're Chinese employee to do this.
This step needs my passport, DS-160, and photo.

3. record finger print, there're US employee to do this.

4. real interview.

The officer is a handsome guy, below is the interview:

1. brief introduce.

2. ask my resume and look it carefully.

3. ask my research details. I told him my current work.

4. ask my research plan. But I don't have that, so I give him <a href="http://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">our website</a> copy.
He compare it with my resume carefully.

5. ask my dissertation topic. I tell him <a href="http://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/projects/maybe/" target="_blank">my current research</a> again, but in different way.

Finally, he told me my application is approved.
