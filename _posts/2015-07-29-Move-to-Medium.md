After comparison of Hexo, Jekyll, Octopress, FarBox, Ghost, and Medium.
I decide to move parts of my blogs to Medium.

Because the Jekyll is too complicated for me.
And other similar tools require I create or use theme.
Blog should be a place let I **write thought, not `html/css/less/sass` codes**.
Medium does a great job for blog.
I can't say the details of Medium are perfect, but it does do a great job!

So this blog will **no longer** update.

See you at [Medium@xcv58](https://medium.com/@xcv58)!
